# ðŸ›’ Retail Sales Data Analysis (SQL)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover business insights such as revenue trends, customer purchasing behavior, and profitability by category.  
Using **MySQL**, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and created 10+ analysis queries for better decision-making.
